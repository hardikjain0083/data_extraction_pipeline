National Education Policy 2020 Overview

The National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) aims to transform India’s education system by making it more holistic, flexible, multidisciplinary, and aligned with 21st century needs. It stresses core values such as **access, equity, quality, affordability, and accountability** in both school and higher education. The policy emphasizes foundational literacy and numeracy by 2025, restructuring the school curriculum into a 5+3+3+4 design covering ages 3–18. The policy also places special focus on technology integration, teacher training, and adult literacy programs to ensure universal access to high-quality education. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Educational Statistics in India

According to the Ministry of Education’s educational data reports, India collects comprehensive information on the number of recognised educational institutions, enrollment levels, teachers, and literacy rates. These statistics, compiled annually, help plan and monitor educational progress across the country. For example, reports list the number of educational institutions, student enrollment by stage of education, teacher statistics, and literacy rates based on national surveys and government data. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
